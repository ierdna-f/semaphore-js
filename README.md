# semaphore-js
College Project
The idea of the project was to implement a simple webmage with a crossing pass controled by 2 semaphores
and sometimes (randomic) the cars would turn on the street and, otherwise they would go straight.
It should be controled by time and dont let car's crash.
I used object Date() to control it by time, and math.random to implement some times the car would turn.
